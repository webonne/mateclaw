 *
 * <p>Each block already has its own absolute cap (chars), but those caps are
 * mutually blind and sized for large cloud models — stacked together they
 * easily exceed a local 8k/16k window on the very first request, when there
 * is no history to compact. This budget scales every block against the
 * model's effective context window instead: the enforced limit is always
 * {@code min(block's own cap, its share of the injection budget)}, so large
 * windows behave exactly as before while small windows shrink each block
 * proportionally.
