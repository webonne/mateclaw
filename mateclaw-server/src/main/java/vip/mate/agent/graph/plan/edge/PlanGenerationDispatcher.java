/**
 * Routes the graph after the triage node.

 *   <li>{@code needs_planning=false} → {@code DIRECT_ANSWER_NODE} (direct answer, no tools)</li>
 *   <li>{@code needs_planning=true} → {@code STEP_EXECUTION_NODE} (single- or multi-step plan)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the triage key is absent, we default to {@code direct_answer} — an unset
 * {@code needs_planning} means triage did not run to completion, and Occam's
 * razor says treat it as "no planning" rather than auto-splitting a task the
 * system never classified. The previous default ({@code true}) biased every
 * unresolved request into a multi-step plan, which was the main source of the
 * "every request splits into subtasks" behavior (see RFC-008).
