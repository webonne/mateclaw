-- V208: Register the channel message push bean as a built-in tool so it shows
-- up in the tool picker and can be bound per-agent. The agent runtime already
-- discovers the @Tool bean live (auto-available even without a row), but the
-- picker / per-agent binding validation reads mate_tool — without this row
-- operators cannot grant proactive channel push to agents that use an explicit
-- tool allowlist. One row for the bean: the alias index resolves the class
-- simple name to both @Tool methods (list_channel_sessions,
-- send_channel_message), so binding 'ChannelMessageTool' grants the
-- discover-then-push workflow as one capability.
-- Idempotent: MERGE INTO updates the row when the id already matches.

MERGE INTO mate_tool (id, name, display_name, description, tool_type, bean_name, icon, enabled, builtin, create_time, update_time, deleted)

-- Renumbered after the troubleshooting/dev migration streams were integrated.
