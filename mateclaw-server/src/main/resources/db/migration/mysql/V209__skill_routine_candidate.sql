-- V209: Recurring-request candidates for routine mining.
-- A single conversation cannot show that a request is habitual, so the
-- reflection reviewer (which only ever sees one window) correctly treats
-- repeat work as a one-off narrative. This table accumulates the cross-session
-- evidence that reflection structurally cannot see: how many separate
-- conversations opened with substantially the same request, over how many
-- distinct days. Once a cluster clears the recurrence gate it is promoted into
-- a class-level skill. Indexes are declared inline because MySQL does not
-- support CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS.
