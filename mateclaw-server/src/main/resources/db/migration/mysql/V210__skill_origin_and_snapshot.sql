-- V210: Curation provenance + pre-sweep snapshots.
--
-- 1. mate_skill.origin — authorship as a policy flag ('user' | 'agent' |
--    'routine'). source_conversation_id alone cannot gate curation: a skill
--    the user asked for in a live conversation carries one just like a skill
--    the background reviewer invented, so the curator had no way to tell them
--    apart and aged both on the same clock.
--
--    Backfill deliberately stamps every existing conversation-sourced skill as
--    'agent', which reproduces the curator's current candidate set exactly, so
--    upgrading changes no behaviour. Authorship of those rows is genuinely
--    unrecoverable — it is not inferred, it is preserved. Only writes from
--    this version forward carry a true value.
--
-- 2. mate_skill_snapshot — a restore point captured before each mutating
--    sweep. Consolidation rewrites skill bodies and archival moves them out of
--    the active set; both were previously one-way.
--
-- MySQL lacks `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`;
-- both use INFORMATION_SCHEMA guards with PREPARE/EXECUTE instead.
