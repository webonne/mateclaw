# AI Memory System

**Memory is how the system gets better at knowing you.**

Everything else in MateClaw is static the moment you configure it. Agents, tools, knowledge bases — they change when you change them. Memory is the one part that changes on its own, as a byproduct of actual use. That's the whole point.

::: tip Your AI dreams about you while you sleep
That's not a marketing line. It's literal code in the `memory/dreaming/` package.

Every night at 3 AM (default; configurable) a scheduled job runs — its name is **Dreaming**. It walks every agent's conversation trail from the day, consolidates scattered signals into a coherent understanding of you, filters out one-offs and contradictions and stale facts, promotes recurring patterns into `MEMORY.md`, and appends "what it saw, what it concluded, what it rewrote" to `DREAMS.md` — a human-readable audit trail of how memory got to where it is today.

When you open MateClaw the next morning, it **picks up where yesterday left off** — not from zero.

> Every other AI starts each day from scratch. MateClaw continues from where yesterday ended.

This page covers the four layers that make up memory, the files the system writes for each agent, and how agents themselves read and write those files during a conversation.

---

## The four layers

```
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. This turn                                                │
  │     What you're saying, what was just said, auto-trimmed     │
  │     to the model's token budget                              │
  │     Updated: every turn                                      │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼ (after conversation completes)
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  2. Post-chat extraction                                     │
  │     Pulls the worth-keeping bits out of the conversation,    │
  │     writes them into PROFILE.md / MEMORY.md / today's note   │
  │     Updated: asynchronously, after each meaningful chat      │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼ (daily at 3:00 AM, configurable)
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  3. Nightly consolidation (Dreaming)                         │
  │     Scans recent daily notes, finds recurring patterns,      │
  │     merges them into MEMORY.md, logs the run in DREAMS.md    │
  │     Updated: scheduled; manual trigger available             │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼ (next conversation picks up the latest)
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  4. Workspace files as system prompt                         │
  │     The four markdown files are injected every turn          │
  │     Updated: file changes take effect on the next turn       │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer operates at a different timescale. Short-term is *this turn*. Extraction is *after each conversation*. Consolidation is *nightly*. Workspace file injection is *every turn uses whatever's current*. Together they form a loop — what you say becomes context, context becomes files, files become system prompt, system prompt becomes what the agent knows tomorrow.

## Memory knows who's who: per-owner isolation (1.5.0)

Before, an employee's memory was **shared**: whether it was you logged into the web, a colleague in a Feishu group, or an end user coming in through a third-party API, the memory piled into the same `MEMORY.md`. One employee serving multiple people would cross wires.

1.5.0 gives every memory an **owner** and a **visibility scope**.

### A unified owner_key

Whatever the identity source, it normalizes to one prefixed string:

| Source | owner_key |
|---|---|
| Web console | `user:<user id>` |
| IM channel (Feishu / DingTalk / WeCom…) | `<channel>:<sender id>` |
| Third-party API (with endUserId) | `api:<endUserId>` |
| System / cron | `system` |

### Three visibility scopes

| scope | Who reads it | Typical content |
|---|---|---|
| **PERSONAL** | Only the matching owner | Memory extracted from conversations defaults here |
| **TEAM** | Everyone using this employee | Agent config files (AGENTS.md / SOUL.md / PROFILE.md), backfilled legacy data |
| **GLOBAL** | Always visible across employees / workspaces | Preset facts, system reference material |

### Recall prefers personal memory

The system prompt bakes in only the shared TEAM/GLOBAL memory (cacheable); each turn then **prefetches** that owner's personal memory by owner_key. So when someone asks "what stack does my project use," the employee recalls *that person's* private memory files first, not generic KB material.

> On the structured "fact" layer: the **fact recall query itself supports owner-visibility filtering** (PERSONAL is owner-only, TEAM/GLOBAL shared). But the current **automatic fact projection** is built mainly from shared memory files and doesn't set `ownerKey/scope` on insert — so personalization shows up more in the personal-memory-file prefetch; per-owner facts are still being filled in.

### Third-party APIs pass through an end-user identity

`/api/v1/chat` and `/api/v1/chat/stream` request bodies gain an optional **`endUserId`** field (a string, to preserve large-integer precision). One PAT-authenticated integration represents one MateClaw user but can pass a distinct `endUserId` per end user, and memory isolates per end user automatically.

### It's a feature flag

The master switch is `mate.memory.lifecycle-mediator-enabled`.

::: warning Mind the default
The Java property's bare default is `false`, but the `application.yml` **shipped with the release sets it to `true`** — so per-owner isolation is **on by default in a default install**. To go back to the old shared behavior (all writes to TEAM), set it to `false` explicitly in your config.
:::

When on: conversation extraction writes to the owner's PERSONAL memory and recall filters by owner_key; when off, all writes fall back to shared TEAM. Multi-tenant instances stay on; single-user deployments can turn it off.

Under the hood: migration `V137` adds `owner_key` + `scope` columns to `mate_workspace_file` / `mate_memory_recall` / `mate_fact`, backfilling legacy rows as `TEAM` (so no memory gets hidden on upgrade). Memory tools like `remember` resolve owner_key from the current request context — when the flag is on they write to that owner's PERSONAL memory, when off they fall back to shared writes.

---

## Multi-layer memory with pluggable providers

The memory layer is not one hard-coded implementation. It's an **interface** — the multi-layer architecture lets you stack providers:

- The **default provider** is the workspace-file-based memory described in the rest of this page. It ships with MateClaw, and for most people it's all they'll ever need.
- **Custom providers** can be dropped in for specialized retrieval — vector-based long-term memory, graph memory, external memory services.
- **Layering** means a single agent can talk to multiple providers at once. A short-term provider returns recent context; a semantic provider returns related memories; a Wiki provider returns authoritative references. They compose at read time.

For most agents, **default is enough** and you should ignore this section. If you're building something specialized — an agent that needs to remember thousands of facts with vector search, an agent that needs graph-structured memory — this is where you plug in. See [Architecture](./architecture).

---

## The four files every agent has

Every agent has its own workspace. Four markdown files form the backbone of long-term memory:

```
workspace/{agentId}/
├── AGENTS.md          # How the agent uses memory — behavior guide
├── SOUL.md            # Who the agent is — core identity, personality, boundaries
├── PROFILE.md         # Who you are — user profile, preferences, background
├── MEMORY.md          # What matters — key decisions, project context, todos
└── memory/
    ├── 2026-04-09.md  # Daily notes — what happened today, append-only
    ├── 2026-04-10.md
    └── 2026-04-11.md
```

The first four are **injected into the system prompt on every turn** (if `enabled=true`). Daily notes are not — they feed consolidation instead.

### What each file is *for*

- **AGENTS.md** — the agent's user manual for itself. When to write memory, what goes where, what tools are available. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=0`.
- **SOUL.md** — who the agent fundamentally is. Self-awareness, evolution guidance, privacy and boundary principles. Edit when you want to change the agent's character at a deep level. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=1`.
- **PROFILE.md** — what the agent has learned about you. Name, occupation, tech stack, communication preferences. Updated by the extractor when conversations reveal something durable. Full-replace writes. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=2`.
- **MEMORY.md** — what the agent has decided matters enough to keep. Active projects, unresolved decisions, open threads, things you asked it to remember. Updated by both the extractor and the consolidator. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=3`.

::: tip New in 1.3.0: workflows can write memory
From v1.3.0, the [workflow](./workflow) `write_memory` step can write the run's output directly into an employee's `MEMORY.md` (or any enabled memory file) when the flow completes. Four merge strategies: `append` / `replace_section` / `upsert_kv` / `overwrite`. Memory is no longer written exclusively by the conversation extractor or the Dreaming consolidator — a business-process outcome can be persisted too.
:::

### Daily notes

Conversation highlights archived by date, in append mode — multiple conversations in one day concatenate into the same file. Not injected into the system prompt (`enabled=false`). They exist so the consolidator has something to scan at 3 AM.

---

## Short-term: the context window

Before every LLM call, MateClaw builds the prompt that actually gets sent:

```
[System Prompt]                        ← Always first
[Workspace file injection]             ← AGENTS / SOUL / PROFILE / MEMORY
[Conversation context summary]         ← Only if earlier turns got compressed
[Message 1: user]
[Message 2: assistant]
...
[Current user message]                 ← Always last
```

Workspace files are injected sorted by `sort_order`, formatted as:

```
--- AGENTS.md ---
(content)

--- SOUL.md ---
(content)

--- PROFILE.md ---
(content)

--- MEMORY.md ---
(content)
```

Only files with `enabled=true` are included.

### When context gets too big

Three-stage defense:

**Stage 1 — proactive compression.** When estimated total exceeds 75% of the budget (default window 128k tokens), the system calls the LLM to summarize earlier turns. The tail is retained dynamically based on a token budget, with a floor controlled by `preserve-recent-pairs` and `protect-last-min-messages` (whichever is larger; defaults to at least 10 messages). The summary is cached for 30 minutes.

**Stage 2 — emergency recovery.** If the LLM still returns context-too-large, the system stops calling the LLM. It discards older messages, keeps the last 2 turns, and retries once.

**Stage 3 — hard trim.** If tokens are *still* over budget, messages drop from the front until the prompt fits. The last 2 messages are always preserved.

> **Security design** — the summary is injected as a **user message**, not a system message. Deliberate: preventing compressed historical user input from being elevated into system-level instructions eliminates an injection vector.

### Configuration

```yaml
mate:
  agent:
    conversation:
      window:
        default-max-input-tokens: 128000   # Global max
        compact-trigger-ratio: 0.75        # Compression trigger
        preserve-recent-pairs: 2           # Turns preserved verbatim
        summary-max-tokens: 300            # Compression budget
```

---

## Post-chat extraction

After a conversation ends, the system asynchronously pulls out what's memorable and writes it to PROFILE.md, MEMORY.md, and the day's daily note. This happens off the user-response path — it never blocks the next turn.

### What triggers it

After a turn completes, the system handles extraction on a background thread. A few preconditions must pass before it actually runs:

- Auto-summarize is on
- The conversation wasn't itself triggered by the consolidation cron job (avoids recursion)
- Message count meets the minimum (default 4)
- The last user message is long enough (default at least 10 chars)

All pass — extraction begins.

### Concurrency control

- **Cooldown** — same agent won't extract twice within 5 minutes (default)
- **Per-agent lock** — if an extraction is already running for this agent, the new request is skipped

### What the LLM actually does

1. Load conversation messages
2. Read current PROFILE.md, MEMORY.md, today's daily note
3. Build a transcript: up to 30 messages, each truncated to 2000 chars
4. Call the LLM with the memory-summarize prompt templates
5. Parse the JSON response
6. Apply writes

### LLM response schema

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `should_update` | boolean | Whether memory needs updating |
| `reason` | string | Why (for audit) |
| `daily_entry` | string | Content to append to today's daily note |
| `memory_update` | string | Full new content for MEMORY.md |
| `profile_update` | string | Full new content for PROFILE.md |

### File write rules

- **PROFILE.md** — full replace, only if `profile_update` is non-empty
- **MEMORY.md** — full replace, only if `memory_update` is non-empty
- **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** — append, created with date heading if missing

---

## Consolidation and dreaming

The third layer runs on a schedule. Its job is to watch daily notes pile up and periodically ask: *what's the pattern here, what should be promoted into core memory, what's stale and should be forgotten?*

### What it does

1. Lists the agent's `memory/*.md` files, takes the most recent 7 days
2. Reads those + the current MEMORY.md
3. Calls the LLM with the consolidation prompt templates
4. The LLM returns `{should_update, reason, memory_content}`
5. If `should_update` is true, MEMORY.md is fully replaced

### Trigger methods

- **Automatic** — every agent has a row in the system's scheduled jobs, set to run nightly at 3 AM
- **Manual** — `POST /api/v1/memory/{agentId}/emergence`

### Why it's not recursive

Consolidation triggers a "conversation" through the agent. Without protection, that conversation would re-trigger the post-chat extraction listener, which would trigger another conversation, ad infinitum.

The event carries a trigger-source flag. The extraction listener sees that the conversation was started by the consolidation job and skips it.

### DREAMS.md — the consolidation diary

Each consolidation run appends a short entry to `workspace/{agentId}/DREAMS.md`:

- what it looked at
- what patterns it found
- what changed in MEMORY.md
- the date

Human-readable audit trail — open DREAMS.md and see *how* the memory got to its current state. Caps its own growth; old entries get summarized when the file exceeds a threshold.

### Scored emergence and recall tracking

Consolidation tracks:

- **Which memory entries were actively recalled** in recent conversations — read patterns feed back into importance
- **Scored emergence** — candidate patterns ranked by frequency + recency + explicit recall, only high-scoring ones make it into MEMORY.md
- **Multi-gate filtering** — low-signal extractions (one-off mentions, contradictions, things the user later corrected) get filtered before becoming memory
- **Dreaming status API** — `GET /api/v1/memory/{agentId}/dreaming/status`

### Full lifecycle (opt-in via flag)

Memory grows from "dream nightly" to a complete turn-by-turn lifecycle. This behavior lands behind feature flags — default off in the open-source build, on in production builds.

What it does:

- **Every turn is bookkept** — the system takes notes at the start and end of every turn, not just at nightly consolidation
- **Fact projection** — conversations are projected into structured "fact" rows the agent can query. Trust scoring + decay built in.
- **Structured nightly report** — consolidation produces a full report; you can re-consolidate by topic on demand
- **Morning card** — the first conversation of the day surfaces yesterday's report; you Confirm / Edit / Forget each fact
- **Contradiction inbox** — when new facts conflict with old ones, you get a queue instead of silent overwrites
- **Explicit forget** — say "forget that," and it actually forgets, everywhere
- **Feedback scoring** — thumbs up/down on retrieved facts feeds back into trust
- **SOUL auto-evolution** — the agent's persona file rewrites itself from accumulated facts
- **Monthly archive** — old reports roll into a compressed monthly archive, browsable in the timeline
- **Memory Browser** — timeline, facts, contradictions, diff viewer, and a trust bar across the top

Enable in `application.yml` (these flags all live under `mate.memory`, grouped by phase):

```yaml
mate:
  memory:
    # Phase 1: turn-by-turn lifecycle bus
    lifecycle-mediator-enabled: true
    dream:
      focused-enabled: true        # focused dream endpoint
      archive-enabled: true        # monthly archive rotation
      archive-keep-days: 30
      max-candidates-per-dream: 100
    # Phase 2: SOUL auto-evolution
    soul-update-interval: 20       # one SOUL.md rewrite every 20 writes (0 = off)
    # Phase 3: fact projection
    fact:
      projection-enabled: true
      projection-rebuild-cron: "0 */30 * * * ?"
      contradiction-check-enabled: false   # contradiction detection (experimental, off by default)
      trust-half-life-days: 60
      forget-enabled: true         # the "Forget" button in the UI
```

> The morning card is an endpoint (`GET /api/v1/memory/{agentId}/dream/morning-card`), not a standalone flag — it has data as long as the fact-projection + dream lifecycle is on.

## Bounding always-on memory size

::: tip New
The memory that gets injected into the system prompt on every turn — `user` / `feedback` structured entries, `PROFILE.md`, `MEMORY.md` — has a silent problem: **it only ever grows**. As entries accumulate, each round's token cost climbs steadily. This group of mechanisms puts deterministic size limits on always-on memory.
:::

Three layers, each covering a different stage:

### Injection budget (truncate at inject time, disk untouched)

When `user` / `feedback` structured entries are injected into the system prompt they are sorted by their `Updated:` date (LRU) and only the most recent N are kept. Entries beyond the limit are **discarded at inject time** — the on-disk file is not modified — and the block footer discloses how many were omitted.

- `mate.memory.system-block-max-chars` (default `4000`): character cap for the always-on structured block; when exceeded, entries are dropped oldest-first. `0` = unlimited.
- `mate.memory.system-block-max-entries-per-type` (default `40`): maximum entries injected per type (`user` / `feedback`). `0` = unlimited.

### Nightly consolidation (shrink files at the storage layer)

The injection budget truncates at inject time, but the on-disk files keep growing. **Consolidation** compacts them at the storage layer: a nightly job (default 03:30, on its own schedule independent of [Dreaming](#consolidation-and-dreaming)) walks each agent's shared bucket and all per-owner buckets, and when entry count exceeds the threshold it calls the LLM to merge near-duplicate or stale entries and writes the result back.

One **safety invariant**: the entry count after consolidation can only decrease — if the model hallucinates additional entries, that write is skipped entirely.

- `mate.memory.structured-consolidation-enabled` (default `true`): when off, only the injection budget applies — no storage-side merging.
- `mate.memory.structured-consolidation-min-entries` (default `8`): buckets with fewer entries than this skip the LLM call to save cost.
- `mate.memory.structured-consolidation-cron` (default `"0 30 3 * * ?"`): independent schedule; does not affect Dreaming.
- `mate.memory.structured-consolidation-max-owners-per-run` (default `50`): maximum owner buckets processed per agent per run; the rest are deferred to the next run. `0` = unlimited.

Manual trigger: `POST /api/v1/memory/{agentId}/structured-consolidation` — returns stats including `ownersConsolidated`, `updated`, `entriesBefore`, and `entriesAfter`.

> Don't confuse this with [Dreaming](#consolidation-and-dreaming): Dreaming merges daily notes into `MEMORY.md` (promoting what matters); consolidation deduplicates and trims `user` / `feedback` structured entries. Two different jobs, two different schedules.

### File ceiling (deterministic hard cap at rewrite time)

`PROFILE.md` and `MEMORY.md` are fully rewritten by the LLM. The prompt asks for conciseness, but there is no hard constraint, so files can still grow unbounded. The file ceiling is the **deterministic fallback at write time**: if the content exceeds the budget it is truncated at the last `##` section boundary that still fits (preserving the head of the file), and a truncation marker is appended.

- `mate.memory.profile-max-chars` (default `4000`): hard character cap for PROFILE.md. `0` = unlimited.
- `mate.memory.memory-md-max-chars` (default `8000`): hard character cap for MEMORY.md. `0` = unlimited.

---

## Agents reading and writing their own memory

Memory isn't just something that *happens to* an agent. The agent itself can actively read and write its own files during a conversation, through a set of workspace memory tools:

| Method | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `list_workspace_memory_files` | List files, optional filename prefix filter, sorted by `sort_order` |
| `read_workspace_memory_file` | Read a specific file's content |
| `write_workspace_memory_file` | Create or overwrite a file (full replace) |
| `edit_workspace_memory_file` | Find-and-replace edit (incremental, `replaceAll` supported) |

### Keyword search over its own memory

::: tip New in 1.4.0
An employee can do more than read whole files — during a conversation it can **search all of its workspace memory files by keyword** and jump straight to the line.
:::

This is an agent runtime capability: the employee supplies a keyword and the system searches across its own workspace memory files:

- **Tokenization** — CJK is split into 2-character sliding windows, Latin text on whitespace, so both languages match
- **Per-file weighted scoring** — hits in core files like `AGENTS.md` / `MEMORY.md` / `PROFILE.md` rank above hits in the daily ledger
- **What comes back** — each hit gives a filename + line number + an 80-char context snippet (matched term highlighted) + a relevance score
- **Scan scope** — up to ~50 candidate files, sorted by score, highest first

Use it when the employee wants to confirm "did I note this before?" or recover a specific decision spread across many days of notes — without pulling whole files into context.

### Examples

**List:**

```json
// in
{"agentId": 1, "filenamePrefix": "memory/"}
// out
{"agentId": 1, "count": 3, "files": [
  {"filename": "memory/2026-04-09.md", "enabled": false, "fileSize": 512},
  ...
]}
```

**Read:**

```json
// in
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md"}
// out
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md", "enabled": true, "content": "..."}
```

**Edit:**

```json
// in
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md", "oldText": "old", "newText": "new"}
// out
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md", "replacements": 1}
```

### Safety rules

- `.md` files only
- No absolute paths, no `..` directory traversal
- `write` is a full overwrite — read first if you care about existing content
- Newly created files have `enabled=false` by default

---

## Memory snapshot export / import

::: tip New in 1.4.0
An employee's entire accumulated memory can be packaged into a ZIP and taken with you — for backup, migration to another deployment, or cloning a coworker who "already knows you."
:::

A snapshot packages an employee's core memory into a single ZIP:

- `AGENTS.md` / `MEMORY.md` / `PROFILE.md` / `SOUL.md` / `KNOWLEDGE.md`
- daily ledger files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- a `manifest.json` (what's in the package, and which employee it came from)

### Three endpoints

| Method | Path | Role | What it does |
|--------|------|------|--------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/workspace/memory/export` | Viewer | Export the ZIP — even read-only access can take a backup |
| POST | `.../workspace/memory/import/preview` | Member | **Dry run**: parse the ZIP, classify each file as create / update / skip, write nothing |
| POST | `.../workspace/memory/import` | Member | Apply the import, written **atomically** |

Preview to see the diff, confirm, then import — you always know what will change before it does.

### Safety guards

- **Whitelist** — only the file types listed above are accepted; everything else is ignored
- **Zip-bomb guards** — ≤ 500 entries, ≤ 1 MB each (uncompressed), ≤ 16 MB total; anything over is rejected
- **UI toggle state is not serialized** — `enabled` / `sortOrder` are kept out of the snapshot; on import into a new employee the target decides them by seed rules, rather than forcing the source's toggle state

### UI

- The **Agent Context page right panel** has **Export / Import** buttons
- Import shows a **diff** first (what's created, overwritten, skipped) and only writes after you confirm

## Mem0 Integration (Optional)

::: warning Not in the default stack
Mem0 integration is an **optional community contribution** — it is NOT part of a default MateClaw install. It requires you to **self-host a Mem0 service** (FastAPI + pgvector + optional Neo4j). MateClaw's "local-first, zero external dependencies" stance is unchanged — this plugin just adds an **additive semantic recall channel** for people willing to run that extra service.
:::

[Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) is a standalone memory service that handles LLM memory extraction, deduplication, and vector-based recall. MateClaw's `mateclaw-plugin-mem0` module plugs it in as a **plugin-style memory provider** — none of the 4 built-in providers (Builtin / Structured / Session / Fact) are touched. Mem0 stacks on top as a 5th, external provider. **They don't replace each other.**

### What it does

| Hook | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `systemPromptBlock` | Returns empty — leaves the resident system prompt alone, avoids per-turn token bloat |
| `prefetch(agentId, query, ownerKey)` | When `searchEnabled=true` and `ownerKey` is non-blank, calls `POST {baseUrl}/memories/search/` and returns a `[Mem0 Recall]` block concatenated into the current turn's context |
| `syncTurn(agentId, conversationId, userMessage, assistantReply, ownerKey)` | When `syncEnabled=true` and `ownerKey` is non-blank, **asynchronously** pushes this turn's user/assistant messages to `POST {baseUrl}/memories/` under `user_id = ownerKey` — the same identifier recall queries by. Failures are logged only, never block the response |
| `getToolBeans` | Empty list — v1 exposes no agent-callable tools |

**Fault isolation**: any exception in recall or sync is swallowed and logged by the plugin itself; the platform keeps going with the other providers. Mem0 being down does not affect MateClaw's local memory.

### Per-owner isolation mapping

Mem0 isolates by `user_id` + `agent_id`. MateClaw maps them as:

| MateClaw field | Mem0 field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ownerKey` (e.g. `user:42` / `feishu:sender_abc`) | `user_id` | Passed through verbatim |
| `agentId` | `agent_id` | The digital employee ID |

Both `prefetch` and `syncTurn` receive `ownerKey` from the platform, so writes and recalls are keyed by the same `user_id`. The variants without `ownerKey` skip (empty recall / dropped write) — Mem0 requires `user_id`, without it isolation is impossible.

### Installation

1. **Deploy Mem0**: following Mem0's official docs, self-host an instance (FastAPI + pgvector + optional Neo4j). Note its base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:8080`.
2. **Build the plugin JAR**: from the MateClaw repo root, run `mvn -pl mateclaw-plugin-mem0 -am package` — the JAR lands at `mateclaw-plugin-mem0/target/mateclaw-plugin-mem0-*.jar`.
3. **Drop the JAR**: place it in MateClaw's `plugins/` directory.
4. **Configure**: in the plugin admin UI, set `baseUrl` (required) and optionally `apiKey` and other tunables. Restart or reload the plugin.

### Configuration

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `baseUrl` | string | yes | — | Mem0 REST API base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:8080` |
| `apiKey` | string | no | — | Bearer token sent as the `Authorization` header to Mem0 |
| `searchEnabled` | boolean | no | `true` | Whether prefetch should call `/memories/search/` for semantic recall |
| `syncEnabled` | boolean | no | `true` | Whether syncTurn should push each turn to `/memories/` |
| `maxResults` | integer | no | `5` | Cap on memories returned per recall |
| `timeoutMs` | integer | no | `3000` | HTTP timeout in milliseconds, shared by recall and sync |

Config is read once at plugin load — changes require a plugin reload to take effect.

### Known limitations (v1)

- **Turns without a resolved owner are not synced**: `syncTurn` requires `ownerKey`; turns where the platform cannot resolve one (e.g. system-triggered runs) are skipped rather than written under a fallback identifier that recall could never surface.
- **No token budget control**: the `[Mem0 Recall]` block returned by prefetch is concatenated into the context directly — it is NOT subject to the `system-block-max-chars` injection budget (that budget only governs `user`/`feedback` structured entries). `maxResults` is the only size knob.
- **No agent tools**: v1 does not expose `mem0_search` / `mem0_add` style tools for the agent to call proactively. The agent only passively receives prefetch results.
