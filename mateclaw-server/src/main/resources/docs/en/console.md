# Admin Console

The admin console is the Vue 3 SPA that ships with every MateClaw deployment. It runs in your browser (or inside the Electron desktop window), talks to the Spring Boot backend over REST + SSE, and exposes every capability MateClaw has — chat, agents, knowledge, tools, skills, channels, security, cron jobs, usage analytics — behind one login.

This page is the map. It walks the sidebar group by group, page by page, and points at the API endpoints each page uses so you can automate anything the UI lets you click.

---

## Tech stack

- **Framework** — Vue 3 + Composition API + TypeScript
- **State** — Pinia (domain-driven)
- **UI** — Element Plus + TailwindCSS 4 + `--mc-*` CSS variables
- **Build** — Vite 6 (vue-tsc type check → static output into the backend JAR's `static/`)
- **Routing** — Vue Router, history mode
- **i18n** — vue-i18n (`zh-CN` / `en-US`)
- **HTTP** — Axios for REST, native `fetch` for SSE
- **Auth** — JWT with automatic injection and sliding-window renewal

---

## Layout

Left sidebar + right content area (`MainLayout.vue`). Sidebar collapses, state persists to `localStorage`. Bottom of the sidebar holds theme toggles (light / dark / system) and current user info.

### Sidebar groups

Six groups matching the intent-based information architecture:

| Group | Pages |
|-------|-------|
| **Chat** | Chat Console |
| **Use** | Agents, Wiki, Memory Explorer, Multimodal Studio, Sessions |
| **Extend** | Tools, Skills, MCP Servers |
| **Operate** | Channels, Cron Jobs, Token Usage, Dashboard, Datasources |
| **Workspace** | Current workspace overview, Members, Activity |
| **System** | Settings, Security & Approval, Doctor, Onboarding |

Pages you don't have permission to see (based on workspace role) are hidden.

### Sidebar notification badges (new in 1.4.0)

The sidebar surfaces live badges in two spots to flag things needing your attention:

- **Pending approvals** — a red count badge; clicking jumps to [Security & Approval](./security)
- **Stuck employees** — an orange dot; clicking jumps to the **Live** runtime view on the Employees page (see [Backstage](./backstage))

### Auth guard

Every route except `/login` is protected by a `beforeEach` route guard checking for a valid JWT in `localStorage`. Set `VITE_SKIP_AUTH=true` in development to bypass.

---

## Pages

### 1. Login

**Route:** `/login`

Username/password form with password visibility toggle.

- On success, stores token + username + role + active workspace in `localStorage`
- Redirects to the chat console (or to the onboarding wizard on first login)

**API:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login`

**Default credentials:** `admin` / `admin123` — change immediately.

---

### 2. Onboarding wizard

**Route:** `/onboarding`

Shown automatically on first login. Four-step wizard:

1. **Welcome** — short product overview
2. **Configure a model** — pick a provider and paste an API key (or OAuth into ChatGPT Plus, or auto-detect Ollama); as of 1.4.0 this step does **provider enablement** directly — tick the providers you want and they're live
3. **Pick an agent template** — seeds a default agent based on your choice
4. **Send the first message** — a test prompt so you can see streaming work

Skipping drops you on the chat console.

---

### 3. Chat Console

**Route:** `/chat`

The primary interaction surface. Conversations on the left, active chat on the right.

Features:

- **Agent selector** — each agent has its own conversation history
- **Conversation list** — grouped by date (Today / Yesterday / Last 7 Days / Earlier)
- **Model switcher** — pick any configured model for this conversation
- **Grouped model dropdown** — groups by provider and tag, with search
- **Message bubbles** — Markdown + code highlighting
- **Segmented messages** — thinking / tool_call / tool_result / content progressively loaded and persisted in real time
- **Thinking panel** — expand/collapse to see reasoning chain
- **Tool call visualization** — tool name, arguments, result inline
- **Phase status indicator** — current phase shown above the stream
- **Persistent task list** — Plan-and-Execute plans + step statuses in a side panel that survives refresh
- **Tool approval cards** — inline approve/reject buttons
- **File upload** — click / paste / drag
- **Stop generation** — interrupt streaming mid-flight
- **Suggestions** — prompt chips when a conversation is empty

**API:**

- `POST /api/v1/chat/stream` — SSE streaming (native fetch)
- `POST /api/v1/chat/upload`
- `POST /api/v1/chat/{conversationId}/stop`
- approval resolution is sent as `/approve` or `/deny` through `POST /api/v1/chat/stream`
- `GET /api/v1/chat/{conversationId}/pending-approvals`
- `GET /api/v1/conversations` — list
- `GET /api/v1/conversations/{id}/messages`

---

### 17. Settings

Sub-route layout with four child pages. A floating button pinned to the bottom of the settings sub-nav **collapses/expands** it (new in 1.4.0).

#### 17.1 Models

**Route:** `/settings/models` (default Settings page)

Manage model providers and model configs. Card grid.

- Provider cards — name, icon, ID, builtin/custom badge, active status, base URL, masked API key, model count
- Add custom provider (OpenAI-compatible)
- Manage models under a provider
- Test connection
- **Discover models** — auto-fetch
- Per-model test button
- Delete custom provider

See [Models](./models).

#### 17.2 System

**Route:** `/settings/system`

Global system parameters.

- Language, stream response, debug mode
- **Search service** — provider chain, fallback, API keys (masked)
- **Default agent**

**API:** `/api/v1/settings`

#### 17.3 Workspaces, Members, Activity

**Route:** `/settings/workspaces`, `/settings/members`, `/settings/activity`

- Create / rename / delete workspaces
- Invite / remove members, assign roles (owner / admin / member / viewer)
- Activity feed — recent workspace events

See [Workspaces](./workspaces).

#### 17.4 Feature Flags

**Route:** `/settings/feature-flags`

Runtime-toggleable feature flags. Each row is one flag — flip a switch and the backend honors it without a restart.

What a row exposes:

- **Key** (monospace) — e.g. `wiki.ocr.enabled`, `wiki.hot_cache.enabled`, `wiki.compile.4stage.enabled`
- **Description** — short human-facing copy
- **Toggle** — enabled / disabled
- **Scope** — optional `whitelist_kb_ids` (CSV), `whitelist_user_ids` (CSV), `rollout_percent` (0–100). Set any of these and the flag becomes scoped: only listed KBs / users / a deterministic-hash percentage see it on.
- **Wired badge** — flags whose backend consumer hasn't been hooked up yet render greyed out with a "Not yet implemented" badge so you don't try to toggle something that won't take effect.

**API:** `/api/v1/feature-flags`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | List all flags |
| `PUT` | `/{flagKey}` | Patch `enabled`, `description`, whitelists, or `rollout_percent` |

Evaluation order at runtime: `enabled=false` → off; whitelist match → on; `rollout_percent` → deterministic `floorMod(id, 100) < rolloutPercent`; otherwise on. The store caches reads for 30 s; admin writes invalidate the cache immediately.

#### 17.5 About

**Route:** `/settings/about`

Version info, tech stack, credits.

---

### 18. Security & Approval

Sub-route layout with four child pages.

#### 18.1 Tool Guard

**Route:** `/security/tool-guard`

Rule-based Tool Guard configuration.

- **Rules table** — name, severity, category, decision, builtin flag, enabled, priority
- Create / edit / delete / reorder / toggle

See [Security & Approval](./security).

#### 18.2 File Guard

**Route:** `/security/file-guard`

- Global enable/disable
- Allowed paths, denied paths, workspace-scoped overrides

#### 18.3 Approvals

**Route:** `/security/approvals`

Pending and historical approvals.

- Filter by status (pending / approved / rejected / expired)

- Export to CSV

---

### 19. Backstage — admin runtime console

**Route:** `/backstage`  ·  **Requires:** `ROLE_ADMIN`

## Pinia stores

MateClaw uses domain-driven Pinia stores. Each store owns its slice of state exclusively.

| Store | File | Owns |
|-------|------|------|
| `useAgentStore` | `stores/useAgentStore.ts` | Agent list + CRUD |
| `useWorkspaceStore` | `stores/useWorkspaceStore.ts` | Current workspace + membership |
| `useWikiStore` | `stores/useWikiStore.ts` | KBs, pages, raw materials |
| `useCronJobStore` | `stores/useCronJobStore.ts` | Cron jobs |
| `useThemeStore` | `stores/useThemeStore.ts` | Theme mode, persistence |

Chat state is **not** in a global store — it's managed by the `useChat` composable (`composables/chat/useChat.ts`), scoped to the chat component's lifecycle.

### State ownership

```typescript
// Correct — go through store actions
agentStore.fetchAgents()
themeStore.setMode('dark')

// Wrong — never mutate directly
agentStore.agents = []         // Don't
```

---

## Dark mode

Three modes: **Light**, **Dark**, **System**. Toggle in the sidebar footer.

- `useThemeStore` persists mode to `localStorage`
- Toggling adds/removes `dark` class on `<html>`
- TailwindCSS 4 uses `dark:` prefix
- Element Plus themes switched via `--mc-*` CSS variables
- System mode uses `matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`

For complex styling, use the `--mc-*` design tokens so transitions are automatic.

---

## Internationalization

- `zh-CN` — Simplified Chinese (default)
- `en-US` — English

Files in `src/i18n/`. Switching: `Settings → System → Language`. Takes effect immediately.

---

## API layer

### Axios instance

```typescript
const http = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api/v1',
  timeout: 30000,
})
```

**Request interceptor** — reads JWT from `localStorage`, injects into `Authorization` header.

**Response interceptor** — unwraps `R<T>: { code, msg, data }`, picks up `X-New-Token` for sliding-window renewal, handles 401/403 by clearing token and redirecting to login.

### SSE streaming

Chat streaming uses native `fetch`, not Axios:

```typescript
fetch('/api/v1/chat/stream', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'text/event-stream',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
```

Response is read incrementally via `ReadableStream` and parsed segment by segment.

## Build and development

```bash
cd mateclaw-ui
npm install
npm run dev       # Port 5173, proxies /api to :18088
npm run build     # vue-tsc + vite build into ../mateclaw-server/.../static
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

Build artifacts embed in the Spring Boot JAR.

Tips:

- **Hot reload** — HMR enabled in dev
- **Path alias** — `@` → `src/`
- **Auto-import** — Element Plus components auto-imported
- **Styling priority** — TailwindCSS utility classes first
- **Skip auth** — `VITE_SKIP_AUTH=true` bypasses login
