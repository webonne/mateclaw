# Channels

**Same brain, same memory, everywhere your team works.**

A channel in MateClaw is a different door into the same agent. Your team chats in Feishu? Put an agent in Feishu. Someone prefers Telegram? Same agent, same memory, in Telegram. Web console for the operators, DingTalk for the field, Slack for engineering — one deployment, nine doors.

Every channel is an adapter. Underneath the adapter, the agent doesn't know (or care) which door the message came through.

::: tip 1.3.0 channel-layer hardening
v1.3.0 lands a wave of long-run stability and group-collaboration work in the channel layer:

- **Reply queue + lifecycle gate** — separates "channel connection ready" from "messages dispatchable"; events received during a reconnect window are no longer dropped
- **WS / long-polling channels run on a leader lease** — in multi-instance deployments, only the lease holder replies; the **same inbound message no longer gets answered twice by different nodes**
- **Group-chat per-sender attribution + debounce boundary** — two people talking in the same group no longer get their messages mixed up
- **Adaptive debounce window for paste-split long messages** — a long paste broken into five messages auto-merges back into one
- **WeCom approval cards + keepalive + chunk dedup** — long-task cards survive upstream session timeouts
- **Async tool results forward back to the originating channel** — employee runs a long task, the result lands in Feishu / DingTalk / WeCom / Slack with files uploaded per-channel
- **Scrubbed fake generated-file URLs** — employees no longer hand back `https://example.com/file.docx`-style fictitious links

WeCom-specific tuning lives in [WeCom deep tuning](./wecom-tuning).
:::

::: tip 1.4.0 channel-layer hardening
v1.4.0 makes Feishu a first-class channel — interactive cards, streaming cards, approval cards, native tools, media in/out — plus QR binding for QQ:

- **Feishu interactive cards (Schema 2.0)** — structured replies auto-render as Feishu interactive cards; short plain text stays text
- **Feishu approval cards** — tool-guard approval flows arrive as an Approve / Deny button card; one tap runs the tool to completion
- **Feishu streaming cards (CardKit)** — replies stream char-by-char into a single card
- **Feishu inbound voice transcription** — voice messages go through STT and reach the agent as text
- **Feishu inbound file / audio / video download** — no longer images only; `media_download_enabled` **now defaults to true in 1.4.0**
- **Feishu channel-native tools** — calendar lookup and doc read / write, no MCP server required
- **QQ QR binding** — QQ gets the same scan-to-bind onboarding as DingTalk / Feishu
- **Per-conversation model selection across all IM channels** — IM conversations remember a per-conversation model, just like web

Feishu specifics are spelled out in the [Feishu](#feishu-lark) section below.
:::

::: tip 1.5.0 channel improvements
- **Shared inbound media pipeline** — **WeChat and WeCom** are currently wired onto a shared inbound-media downloader + magic-byte type detection + exponential-backoff retry (other IM channels to follow). File types are decided from content bytes (no more hardcoded `image/*`); HEIC / WEBP / DOCX / XLSX and friends are detected correctly, with automatic retry on download failure.
- **Feishu: follow-up text auto-carries recent files (#201)** — send a file in a Feishu chat first (even without @-mentioning the employee), then a text message, and the cached files are auto-attached as content parts for the employee — 5 files per chat, 60-minute TTL.

```

Every channel implements a unified adapter shape — translating platform-specific events into messages the agent can consume. **Adding a new channel** is a developer task; see [Architecture](./architecture).

### Channel health monitor

Every active IM channel adapter is watched by a health monitor. When an adapter fails to connect or loses its long connection, the monitor kicks off **exponential backoff reconnect** (2s → 4s → 8s → … capped at 30s). Transient blips self-heal; persistent failures surface in the health view on the admin console.

This is why MateClaw channels don't sit silent after a hiccup: they come back on their own.

---

## Channel configuration basics

Channels are managed through **Channel Management** in the admin UI. The underlying row in `mate_channel`:

| Column | What it is |
|--------|-----------|
| `name` | Display name |
| `type` | Channel type (`dingtalk`, `feishu`, `telegram`, …) |
| `agent_id` | Which agent handles messages |
| `config` | JSON object with channel-specific credentials |
| `enabled` | On/off switch |

All credentials encrypted at rest. One agent can have many channels; different channels can talk to different agents.

---

## Web Channel (SSE)

Built in. No setup, no credentials. Uses Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming.

```
POST /api/v1/chat/stream
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: text/event-stream

{"agentId": 1, "message": "...", "conversationId": "..."}
```

Event format documented in [Chat & Messaging](./chat).

---

## DingTalk

Two connection modes (Stream / Webhook) and two message formats (markdown / card).

### One-click QR binding (recommended, v1.1.0+)

**No developer console login. No "add Robot capability." No "create version." Open the channel form, scan a QR, done.**

1. `Channels → New → choose type: DingTalk`
2. In the form, click **Bind DingTalk App via QR** — a DingTalk-blue QR code unfolds
3. Scan it with the DingTalk app and **confirm authorization**
4. Back in the form, **Client ID and Client Secret are auto-filled**

Sessions are valid for 7 minutes; expired sessions auto-invalidate and regenerate. Fill in the rest (connection mode, agent, message format) as you'd like.

::: tip What's happening under the hood
DingTalk's OAuth Device Flow. MateClaw requests a device code from `oapi.dingtalk.com`, encodes it as a QR; once you confirm, credentials land in the form via the polling endpoint. **No webhook, no public IP required.**
:::

### Manual app creation (fallback)

If the QR flow can't reach DingTalk on your network, or you need finer control over the app config, the open-platform path still works:

1. Open [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/), **App Development > Internal Apps > Create App**
   ![Create App](/images/channels/dingtalk/01-create-app.png)

2. **App Capabilities > Add Capability** → add **Robot**
   ![Add Robot](/images/channels/dingtalk/02-add-bot.png)

3. Set message receiving mode to **Stream mode**, publish
   ![Robot Config](/images/channels/dingtalk/03-bot-config.png) ![Stream Mode](/images/channels/dingtalk/04-stream-publish.png)

4. **App Release > Version Management** → create a new version and save
   ![Create Version](/images/channels/dingtalk/05-create-version.png)

5. **Basic Info > Credentials** → get **Client ID** (AppKey) and **Client Secret** (AppSecret)
   ![Credentials](/images/channels/dingtalk/06-credentials.png)

### Configure in MateClaw

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "DingTalk Bot",
    "type": "dingtalk",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "connection_mode": "stream",
      "client_id": "your-client-id",
      "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
      "message_type": "markdown"
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

::: tip
Stream mode uses the official DingTalk SDK to establish a WebSocket long connection. **No public IP required.** For AI Card streaming, set `message_type: card` and provide a template ID.
:::

### Find and use the bot

Search the bot name in DingTalk, find it under **Features**, start chatting.

![Search Bot](/images/channels/dingtalk/07-search-bot.png) ![Find Bot](/images/channels/dingtalk/08-find-bot.png) ![Chat](/images/channels/dingtalk/09-chat.png)

Webhook URL (webhook mode): `https://your-domain/api/v1/channels/webhook/dingtalk`

---

## Feishu (Lark)

WebSocket long connection or Webhook. WebSocket is preferred — no public IP required.

### One-click QR binding (recommended, v1.1.0+)

**Before: "go to the open platform → create an enterprise custom app → copy App ID and App Secret." After: click a button, scan the QR, credentials arrive.**

1. `Channels → New → choose type: Feishu`
2. In the form, click **Bind Feishu App via QR** — a QR code unfolds
3. Scan it with **the Feishu app** and **confirm authorization** (for Lark international, switch the domain to `lark`)
4. Back in the form, **App ID and App Secret are auto-filled**

Fill in the rest (agent, plus verification token / encrypt key if you're using webhook mode) as needed. **Sessions are valid for 5 minutes.**

::: tip What's happening under the hood
The Feishu SDK 2.6+ ships a `scene/registration` Device Flow. After bumping `com.larksuite.oapi:oapi-sdk` to 2.6.1, the entire "create app → copy credentials" detour collapses into a single QR scan.
:::

### Manual app creation (fallback)

If the QR flow can't reach Feishu on your network, or you need webhook mode / custom permission scopes:

1. Open [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/app), create an enterprise custom app
   ![Create App](/images/channels/feishu/01-create-app.png) ![App Info](/images/channels/feishu/02-build.png)

2. **Credentials & Basic Info** → grab **App ID** and **App Secret**
   ![Credentials](/images/channels/feishu/03-credentials.png)

3. **Capabilities** → enable **Bot**
   ![Enable Bot](/images/channels/feishu/04-enable-bot.png)

4. **Permissions** → batch-import:
   ![Permissions](/images/channels/feishu/05-permissions.png)

   ```json
   {
     "scopes": {
       "tenant": [
         "im:chat", "im:message", "im:message.group_msg",
         "im:message.p2p_msg:readonly", "im:resource",
         "contact:user.base:readonly"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Events & Callbacks** → select **WebSocket Long Connection** mode
   ![WebSocket Config](/images/channels/feishu/06-websocket.png)

6. Subscribe to **Receive Messages v2.0**
   ![Subscribe Event](/images/channels/feishu/07-subscribe-event.png)

7. **App Release** → create version and publish
   ![Create Version](/images/channels/feishu/08-create-version.png)

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Feishu Bot",
    "type": "feishu",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "app_id": "cli_your_app_id",
      "app_secret": "your-app-secret",
      "verification_token": "your-verification-token",
      "encrypt_key": "your-encrypt-key"
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

![Add to Favorites](/images/channels/feishu/09-add-favorite.png) ![Chat](/images/channels/feishu/10-chat.png)

Webhook URL: `https://your-domain/api/v1/channels/webhook/feishu`

### Feishu 1.4.0 enhancements

v1.4.0 upgrades Feishu from "can send and receive text" into a full rich-interaction channel. Most of these work with zero config — they're listed here so you know where the switches live and what the defaults are.

#### Interactive cards (Schema 2.0)

Structured replies — JSON, Markdown with headers / tables / lists, long text — auto-render as Feishu **interactive cards**; short plain text still goes out as a normal text message.

| Config | Default | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `card_format` | `auto` | `auto` decides by content; `always` forces cards (for debugging); `never` forces plain text |
| `card_header` | `AI 助手` | Card title text; set to an empty string to suppress the header |

The JSON card payload is capped at ~32 KB; anything larger degrades to plain text.

#### Approval cards

Tool-guard approval flows arrive as a card with **Approve / Deny** buttons. Tapping **Approve** injects a synthetic `/approve`, tapping **Deny** injects `/deny`, and the agent then runs the approved tool end-to-end — approval and execution close the loop in the same conversation, no detour back to the web console.

#### Streaming cards (CardKit)

Replies stream char-by-char into a **single card** instead of waiting for the whole answer before sending.

- `card_streaming_enabled` (default `true`)
- The first token appears immediately; regular text updates coalesce at 500ms, while phase transitions refresh preferentially behind a 120ms platform safety limit
- `stream_progress` (default `true`) keeps thinking status, plan steps, tool progress, and stage narration in the same card; completion retains a bounded execution trace above the final answer
- Set `filter_thinking=false` to show raw model thinking; by default only status and stage progress are shown
- Set `filter_tool_messages=false` to show tool names and per-tool results; by default only the tool count is shown
- On CardKit failure it falls back to accumulate-then-send
- Final update and close operations retry once; if they still fail, a regular Feishu message carries the answer

#### Inbound voice transcription

Feishu voice messages go through speech-to-text (STT) and are fed to the agent as text — the agent sees real words, not an `[audio]` placeholder. **Auto-enabled once STT is configured**, no extra switch.

#### Inbound file / audio / video download

Before 1.4.0 only images were downloaded; now files, audio, and video are downloaded too, cached locally, and surfaced to the agent via `/api/v1/files/generated/{id}`.

::: warning Default change
`media_download_enabled` **now defaults to `true`** in 1.4.0. If disk usage or privacy matters to you, set it explicitly to `false` to opt out.
:::

Size and format limits: images cap at 10 MB (auto-compressed beyond that); files / audio / video cap at 30 MB; audio is opus-only and video is mp4-only, with everything else degrading to plain file handling.

#### Outbound generated files → native attachments

File URLs the agent generates are turned back into native Feishu **attachments** sent directly. On a cache miss, the reply carries a retry hint instead of a dead link.

#### Channel-native tools (no MCP server)

Bind a Feishu channel and the agent immediately gains three native Feishu tools, **no separate MCP server required**:

| Tool | Type | Default |
|------|------|---------|
| `feishu_calendar_list_events` | read | on |
| `feishu_doc_read` | read | on |
| `feishu_doc_create` | write | off, approval-gated |

DB-seeded guard rules automatically apply `NEEDS_APPROVAL` to mutating tools (e.g. `feishu_doc_create`), triggering the approval-card flow above.

#### Sender context injection

In group chats the agent needs to know who's talking. When a Feishu message comes in, the agent prompt automatically carries Channel / Sender / (in groups) Chat context lines. **No config.**

#### DONE reaction

After a successful reply, the bot adds a ✅ reaction to the inbound message as a lightweight "handled" receipt. `enable_done_reaction` (default `true`).

#### Mention filtering

By default the bot responds to anyone in a group chat. Set `require_mention` to `true` (default `false`) and only an @mention triggers it — the check uses the Feishu SDK's mentions field. The bot's own open_id is prefetched on startup with a 60s negative cache (if it can't be resolved, the gate falls open rather than locking the whole group on a single failure).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Feishu Bot",
    "type": "feishu",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "app_id": "cli_your_app_id",
      "app_secret": "your-app-secret",
      "card_format": "auto",
      "card_header": "AI 助手",
      "card_streaming_enabled": true,
      "stream_progress": true,
      "media_download_enabled": true,
      "enable_done_reaction": true,
      "require_mention": false
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

## Telegram

Long-Polling (default) or Webhook. Long-Polling needs no public IP.

### Create bot

1. Search **@BotFather** in Telegram (look for the blue verified badge)
2. Send `/newbot`, follow the prompts
   ![Create Bot](/images/channels/telegram/01-botfather.jpg)
3. Copy the **Bot Token**
   ![Get Token](/images/channels/telegram/02-token.jpg)

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Telegram Bot",
    "type": "telegram",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "bot_token": "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11",
      "show_typing": true,
      "polling_timeout": 20
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

::: tip
- Long-Polling has exponential backoff reconnection (2s → 30s) built in
- Typing indicator is refreshed every 4 seconds
- Users in China may need `http_proxy` configured
:::

## Discord

Built on **JDA** — connects via Gateway WebSocket with automatic reconnection.

### Create bot

1. [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   ![Developer Portal](/images/channels/discord/01-developer-portal.png)

2. Create Application
   ![Create App](/images/channels/discord/02-create-app.png)

3. **Bot** → create a Bot, copy the **Token**
   ![Bot Token](/images/channels/discord/03-bot-token.png)

4. Enable **Message Content Intent**, grant **Send Messages** + **Attach Files**
   ![Permissions](/images/channels/discord/04-permissions.png)

5. **OAuth2 > URL Generator** → select `bot` scope → invite to your server
   ![OAuth2](/images/channels/discord/05-oauth2.png) ![Invite](/images/channels/discord/06-invite.png)

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Discord Bot",
    "type": "discord",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "bot_token": "your-bot-token",
      "accept_bot_messages": false
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

::: tip
- No Webhook URL or Interactions Endpoint needed — Gateway WebSocket handles everything
- Long replies (over 2000 characters) auto-split while preserving code block integrity
- Message deduplication (LRU cache of 500) prevents duplicate processing during reconnects

## QQ

WebSocket / callback modes, on the official bot platform.

### One-click QR binding (recommended, v1.4.0+)

Like DingTalk / Feishu, QQ now supports scan-to-bind — no manual copying of AppID / AppSecret from the open platform.

1. `Channels → New → choose type: QQ`
2. In the form, click **Bind QQ App via QR** — a QR code unfolds
3. Scan it with QQ and **confirm authorization**
4. Back in the form, **AppID and AppSecret are auto-filled**

::: tip What's happening under the hood
This goes through the QQ Open Platform Lite portal: MateClaw mints a temporary session and the credentials land in the form via an AES-256-GCM encrypted exchange. The session is valid for 12 minutes and auto-invalidates on expiry. **No hand-copied credentials anywhere in the flow.**
:::

### Manual app creation (fallback)

If the QR flow can't reach QQ on your network:

1. [QQ Open Platform](https://q.qq.com/) → create a bot application
   ![QQ Open Platform](/images/channels/qq/01-open-platform.png) ![Create Bot](/images/channels/qq/02-create-bot.png)

2. **Callback Configuration** → enable **C2C Message Event** and **Group Message AT Event**
   ![Event Config](/images/channels/qq/03-c2c-event.png)

3. **Development Management** → grab **AppID** and **AppSecret**
   ![Credentials](/images/channels/qq/04-credentials.png)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "QQ Bot",
    "type": "qq",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "app_id": "your-app-id",
      "client_secret": "your-app-secret"
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

---

## Slack

Events API (webhook mode) or Socket Mode (no public IP needed).

### Create app

1. Visit [Slack API — Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app
2. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, grant bot scopes: `chat:write`, `app_mentions:read`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `files:write`
3. Install the app to your workspace
4. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`)
5. For Socket Mode: under **Socket Mode**, enable it and generate an **App-Level Token** with `connections:write` (`xapp-...`)
6. Subscribe to bot events: `app_mention`, `message.im`

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Slack Bot",
    "type": "slack",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "bot_token": "xoxb-...",
      "app_token": "xapp-..."
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

Webhook URL (webhook mode): `https://your-domain/api/v1/channels/webhook/slack`

## WeChat Personal (iLink)

::: warning
WeChat Personal Bot (iLink protocol) is in beta. Access must be applied for before use.
:::

- **Login** — QR code scan on first use; token persists automatically (across restarts)
- **Receiving** — HTTP long polling
- **Sending** — Reply via the `sendmessage` API (text + voice)

Add a WeChat Personal channel in Channel Management, click **Get Login QR Code**, scan with your phone. Token auto-fills on authorization.

### What it survives now

WeChat Personal used to be the flakiest channel. We rebuilt it:

- **Watchdog loop** — no silent pollers that stop reconnecting
- **Jittered exponential backoff** — auto-recovery on token expiry and network blips, no crash-and-stay-dead
- **Per-account staleness detection** — precisely identifies which account connection has gone stale
- **Voice transcription with 3 fallback paths** — covers WeChat CDN's multiple encryption schemes

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "WeChat Personal",
    "type": "weixin",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {"bot_token": "your-bot-token"},
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

## WeChat Official Account (publish target, 1.8.0+)

Unlike the nine conversational channels above, the **WeChat Official Account (公众号)** integration is a **one-way publish transport**, not an inbound message channel. It's used by [Content Studio](./content-studio) to push image-text articles into your Official Account **draft box**.

- Configure the Official Account `app_id` / `app_secret` in **Settings** — the secret is **AES-GCM encrypted at rest** (set `MATECLAW_SETTING_KEY` and back it up).
- The WeChat service instance is cached per appId with a **persisted access token** (WeChat allows one valid token per appId), and the publish chain **retries** transient errors and translates known error codes into actionable hints (e.g. *add the server IP to the Official Account whitelist*).
- Publishing is **draft-box-first**; the optional `publish` action is approval-gated. See [Content Studio](./content-studio).

## Session source tracking

Every channel conversation records where it came from. In the session management view and the chat console, each session shows the corresponding channel icon. Sessions from IM channels belong to the `system` user.

---

## Voice for every channel

IM channels (WeCom, WeChat, DingTalk) support voice input. Transcription via DashScope or OpenAI Whisper, with multi-path fallback for WeChat's encrypted voice CDN. Voice replies are synthesized via text-to-speech and sent back as audio messages.

## Per-conversation model selection (all IM channels)

As of 1.4.0, IM channel conversations **remember a per-conversation model**, just like web. Each IM conversation seeds a conversation-level model when it's created, and later replies respect that choice rather than always falling back to the agent's default model. See [Chat & Messaging](./chat) for the web-side switching detail. As of 2.0.0 you can also switch right inside the IM with the `/model` magic command (next section).

---

## Channel magic commands (2.0.0+)

In any IM channel, a message that is entirely a `/`-prefixed command is intercepted by a unified dispatcher **before it reaches the LLM** — commands register once and work on every channel, burn no tokens, and respond instantly:

| Command | What it does |
|------|--------|
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation (current context is archived) |
| `/clear` | Clear the current conversation's context (the conversation itself survives; the 1.8-era clear command folds into this framework) |
| `/status` | Show the conversation's state — bound employee, model, whether a task is running |
| `/stop` | Stop the running task — intercepted at the enqueue gate, so it preempts a long task mid-flight |
| `/model` | With no argument, list available models (current pin marked); `/model <name>` or `/model <provider>:<name>` switches **this conversation's** model, effective from the next message; `/model reset` restores the default. Fuzzy names get suggestion lists |
| `/help` | List all commands with descriptions |

Every command carries Chinese and English aliases (e.g. `清空` / `新会话` / `状态`) and is case-insensitive. Matching is two-layered: **bare aliases match only as the entire message** ("help me write a report" is a normal prompt, not `/help`); **the slash form matches on the first token with arguments passed through** (which is how `/model qwen-max` carries its argument). A normal message that merely contains `/stop` mid-sentence never misfires. Command confirmations go through the channel's normal render-and-send path, so an already-posted "thinking…" placeholder bubble is properly consumed instead of spinning forever.

## Per-stage progress narration on sync IM channels (2.0.0+)

The worst part of long tasks in IM is the "message dropped into a void" feeling. As of 2.0.0, IM channels on the synchronous path (WeCom, WeChat, …) no longer reply with only the final answer:

- each **stage narration** of the agent's run (what it's doing, which tool it called) arrives as a standalone message — you see the task's footsteps on your phone;
- WeCom goes further with an **event-driven progress bubble** that updates in place — thinking state, live tool trace and elapsed time roll in real time, and the bubble morphs into the final answer when it arrives (details and tuning in [WeCom Deep Tuning](./wecom-tuning));
- the web SSE and sync IM paths share one **per-turn stream accumulator**, so both sides see identical execution metadata (tool calls, token usage).

## Things worth knowing

- **Webhook mode needs HTTPS.** Production deployments should front MateClaw with Nginx + SSL.
- **Long-connection modes need no public IP.** Telegram Long-Polling, DingTalk Stream, Feishu WebSocket, Discord Gateway, Slack Socket mode, WeCom Long connection — all run behind NAT.
- **One channel, one agent.** Different channels can point at different agents.
- **Conversation ids are channel-scoped (2.0.0).** Conversation id generation now encodes the channel identity — two same-type channels created in different workspaces keep separate conversations even for the same external user, so two workspaces' chats can never bleed into one conversation row.
- **Credentials are encrypted at rest** in `mate_channel`.
- **China networks** often need `http_proxy` configured for Telegram and Discord.

## Proactive push and targeted Cron delivery (2.1.0+)

An employee can proactively notify an IM conversation when the task explicitly asks for it:

1. call `list_channel_sessions` to list recent pushable conversations in the current workspace;
2. select the exact returned `conversation_id`;
3. call `send_channel_message` for a one-way text/Markdown notification.

The adapters that currently implement proactive send are QQ, Telegram, WeChat, Slack, Discord, Feishu, DingTalk, and WeCom. The bot must first have received at least one message in that conversation so a verified platform delivery handle exists, and the channel must be running. Guessed ids and cross-workspace targets are rejected; messages are capped at 4096 characters. Ordinary replies still use the current conversation.

Cron edits now retain both delivery channel and target, so changing a schedule or prompt cannot silently lose the destination. This fits scheduled reports, alerts, and asynchronous completion notifications.
