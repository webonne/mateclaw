# Tools

**A tool is a hand the agent can reach out with.**

Left to its own devices, a language model is a pattern-matcher wrapped in text. It doesn't know what time it is. It doesn't know what's in your files. It can't search the web, run a command, look at a PDF, delegate to another agent, or open a browser. It can only *talk about* doing those things.

Tools are how MateClaw fixes this. Each tool is a concrete operation the agent is allowed to invoke — read a file, search the web, execute a shell command, extract text from a PDF, delegate to another agent. When the agent decides it needs one, it emits a **tool call**, the runtime executes it, and the result comes back as an **observation**.

Twenty tools ship built-in. Unlimited more can be added through MCP servers, custom skill scripts, or your own `@Tool`-annotated Spring beans.

## How a tool call actually happens

```
Agent decides it needs a tool
        │
        ▼
  Emits a tool call:  {"name": "WebSearchTool", "args": {"query": "..."}}
        │
        ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │   Tool registry     │  ← look up the tool by name
  └─────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │   Tool Guard        │  ← rule-based check: allow / deny / approval
  └─────────────────────┘
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   │         │
   ▼         ▼
 allowed  approval pending → user decides → allowed / rejected
   │
   ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │  Execute (timeout)  │  ← async, per-tool timeout
  └─────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
  Result → observation → agent's next reasoning step
```

Tool Guard is the gatekeeper. Timeouts are per-tool (so one slow tool can't freeze a turn). Execution can be concurrent inside a single Action phase — if the agent calls three independent tools at once, they run in parallel.

None of this shows up in the agent's prompt. The agent just asks for a tool. The runtime handles everything in front of, during, and after the call.

---

## Tool registration — three paths

**1. Built-in tools.** The twenty tools that ship with MateClaw — registered into the tool table on startup.

**2. MCP servers.** External processes speaking the Model Context Protocol expose tools dynamically. MateClaw discovers them via `tools/list` and they appear in the registry alongside built-in ones. See [MCP](./mcp).

> **Per-agent MCP tool scoping (1.4.0+, #117)**: when an agent has **ticked no specific MCP tool rows**, enabled MCP tools **auto-join** its tool set; once it ticks specific MCP tools, it's **restricted to that set**. Agents bound to skills / built-in tools only keep full access to all MCP tools.

**3. Skill scripts.** Skill packages can ship executable scripts that get wrapped as tools at runtime. See [Skills](./skills).

Tool discovery is **blacklist-style** — every discoverable tool is registered by default. Exclude specific tools explicitly. Newly added tools don't get silently missed.

---

## Progressive tool disclosure (1.4.0+)

As the tool count grows, the system prompt balloons with dozens of full tool schemas — even when a task needs only one or two of them. **Progressive disclosure** splits tools into two tiers so the prompt scales with the **task**, not with the **total tool count**.

| Tier | How it appears in the system prompt | Callable out of the box? |
|------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **CORE** | Always advertised in full, with the complete schema | Yes |
| **EXTENSION** | Only a compressed directory — name + source + one-line description; the full schema stays hidden | No — activate with `enable_tool` first |

**Default tiering**: the generative tools (`image_generate`, `music_generate`, `video_generate`, `model3d_generate`) and `browser_use` default to **EXTENSION**; everything else is **CORE**.

- **Page control** — the Tools page has Core and Extension sections with a per-row tier toggle for built-in and channel tools; MCP / ACP tools are locked.
- **Persistence** — the tier is stored in `mate_tool.disclosure_tier` and `mate_mcp_server.disclosure_tier`.
- **Config** — `mateclaw.tools.disclosure.mode`, default `progressive`; set it to `legacy` to restore the old "advertise everything" behavior.

**Why** — to stop context bloat. The system prompt should scale with what the current task needs, not with how many tools you've installed.

### Content Studio tools (1.8.0+)

Seven built-in tools power the [Content Studio](./content-studio) scene (公众号 / 小红书 image-text creation and publishing):

| Tool | What it does | Dangerous |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| `wechat_article_extract` | Clean a `mp.weixin.qq.com` article into `{title, author, time, body, images}` (SSRF-limited to that host) | — |
| `gzh_package` | Package a WeChat Official Account article (inline HTML + cover); runs compliance scan + records to the content calendar | — |
| `gzh_publish` | Push the article to the WeChat **draft box** (`draft`); optional `publish` is approval-gated | ⚠️ |
| `xhs_package` | Package a Xiaohongshu note; hard-validates ≥3 vertical cards; scans + records | — |
| `xhs_publish` | Best-effort browser-assisted upload (approval-gated) | ⚠️ |
| `content_item` | Content calendar: `check_recent` (topic-fingerprint dedup), `record`, `mark_published` | — |
| `compliance_scan` | Server-side lexicon scan (extreme-claim / inducement / guaranteed-return terms); optional `extraBannedWords` | — |

### DateTimeTool

Returns the current date and time for a given timezone. Zero surprises.

```
Input:  {"timezone": "America/New_York"}
Output: "2026-04-11T14:30:22"
```

### WebSearchTool

Web search via a **provider chain** — DuckDuckGo and SearXNG as keyless fallbacks, Serper and Tavily when you have keys. Configured in `Settings → System → Search Service` and takes effect without restart.

```
Input:  {"query": "Spring AI Alibaba latest version", "freshness": "month", "count": 5}
Output: "Spring AI Alibaba 1.1 was released..."
```

Features:

- **Provider chain** — falls through to the next on failure. Keyless providers provide baseline coverage.
- **Advanced parameters** — `freshness` (day/week/month/year), `language`, `count`.
- **Result caching** — recent queries are cached.
- **Security wrapping** — results sanitized before return.
- **Provider-native + tool search coexistence** — models with their own search (ChatGPT, Gemini) can use that natively while tool search is available as fallback.

### ShellExecuteTool

Cross-platform shell execution. Linux/macOS uses `/bin/sh -c`; Windows uses `cmd.exe /D /S /C`. **Every call is gated by Tool Guard.**

Safety design:

- **Timeout** — 60s default, 300s hard cap
- **Output caps** — stdout and stderr capped at 10,000 bytes each
- **File-backed output** — stdout/stderr to temp file, not pipe
- **Structured result** — `{exitCode, stdout, stderr, timedOut}`
- **Dangerous-pattern detection** — `find -delete`, `rm -rf /`, piped bash downloads trigger elevated approval

```
Input:  {"command": "ls -la /tmp"}
Output: "total 48\ndrwxrwxrwt 12 root root..."
```

### ReadFileTool / WriteFileTool / EditFileTool

Read is safe. Write and Edit are both gated by Tool Guard.

### DocumentExtractTool

PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and friends become plain text. Scanned documents get OCR fallback where available.

### Office document generation (1.3.0+)

Four new tools that render Markdown directly into downloadable Office files — **no subprocess fork, no npm dependency**. Generated bytes are cached in memory and returned as a one-time download URL:

| Tool | Use for | Key capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `DocxRenderTool.renderDocx` | Reports / memos / contracts / resumes | Headings (# ## ###) / bold (**text**) / lists / tables / images (PNG/JPG/GIF/BMP/SVG → PNG) |
| `DocxRenderTool.renderDocxFromFile` | Same, but markdown is in a workspace file | Avoids the LLM having to repeat its own large markdown body as a tool argument |
| `XlsxRenderTool.renderXlsx` | Financial sheets / data exports / templates | Markdown table syntax → multiple sheets (split by `## SheetName`) |
| `PptxRenderTool.renderPptx` | Decks / project plans / briefings | Marp-style `---` slide breaks; `16:9` (default) / `4:3` aspect |
| `PptxRenderTool.renderPptxFromFile` | Same, but markdown in a file | Preferred when the deck body exceeds 5KB |
| `PdfRenderTool.renderPdf` | Publication-grade documents / weekly reports / templated docs | 1in margins / smart pagination / page numbers / cover page / mixed CJK + Latin (CJK fonts embedded) |

::: tip Relationship with the existing `skills/docx` skill
The `skills/docx` skill **stays** — it's good at **editing existing .docx** (tracked changes, complex XML ops) and runs `npm install docx` on first use. The four new tools handle the "create-from-scratch" path with **no npm warm-up cost**. Agents prefer these RenderTools; fall back to the skill only when modifying an existing .docx.
:::

### ImageGenerateTool — image edit support from 1.3.0

In v1.2.0 this tool was text-to-image only. v1.3.0 adds two parameters — `image` and `images` — for **multi-image input editing**. See [Multimodal](./multimodal#image-edit).

### WorkspaceMemoryTool

Lets an agent read, write, and edit its own workspace memory files — `MEMORY.md`, `PROFILE.md`, daily notes, anything under `workspace/{agentId}/`. Safety rules: `.md` only, no directory traversal. See [Memory](./memory).

### BrowserUseTool

Drives a browser. Navigate, click, type, extract. Every call gated by Tool Guard.

**Ref interaction (1.8.0+).** The tool reads a page as a compact **accessibility-tree snapshot** where every interactive element gets a stable `ref` handle, and click / type / select target the **element by its `ref`** rather than a screenshot coordinate — so an action survives a page reflow instead of missing. Using a **real** browser session adds **privacy guardrails**, with a controlled CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) escape hatch for cases the safe path can't reach (opt-in, not default).

### DelegateAgentTool — agents delegating to agents

One agent can hand off a subtask to another:

- **`delegateToAgent(agentName, task)`** — call a specific agent by name, run in isolated conversation, return the result
- **`listAvailableAgents()`** — list all available agents with name, type, description

```
User: Search for Spring AI news and have Writer summarize it
Agent A: [calls WebSearchTool]
         [calls delegateToAgent(agentName="Writer", task="Summarize: ...")]
         [receives Writer's response]
         Replies with the combined result
```

Safety:

- **Recursion cap** — maximum 3 delegation levels deep
- **Isolated sessions** — the delegated agent runs in its own conversation
- **Result truncation** — delegated results capped at 4000 characters

### MateClawDocTool

Reads the built-in MateClaw project documentation. Lets an agent answer "how does X work in MateClaw" questions by consulting actual docs rather than guessing.

### enable_tool — activate an extension-tier tool (1.4.0+)

`enable_tool(toolName)` activates an **EXTENSION**-tier tool so it becomes fully callable for the **rest of the conversation**.

- **Validated** — only tools in the agent's effective set can be activated.
- **Takes effect next turn** — activation lands on the **next reasoning turn** of the same ReAct loop (the agent sees the full schema, then emits the real call).
- **Conversation-scoped, not persisted** — activation lasts only for the current conversation; nothing is written to the database, and a new conversation reverts to the default tiering.

### load_skill — load a skill on demand (1.4.0+)

`load_skill(skillName, filePath?)` pulls a skill's `SKILL.md` in only when it's needed — omit `filePath` for the main file, or pass one to read a sub-file inside the skill package.

- **Injected via message history** — the loaded content goes into **message history**, not the system prompt, so the **prompt cache stays stable** (the system prompt is unchanged, so the cache isn't invalidated).
- **Pinned in later turns** — a loaded skill stays **pinned** for the rest of the conversation, so it doesn't have to be reloaded.
- **Config** — `mateclaw.skill.disclosure.load-skill-tool.enabled`, default true.

See [Skills](./skills).

### send_file — deliver an existing file as a native attachment (1.4.0+, #199)

`send_file(filePath, fileName?)` reads an **existing file** on the server and delivers it as a **native IM attachment** — not a text download link.

- **Stored in the generated-file cache** — the file is placed in the generated-file cache, and channel adapters (Feishu / DingTalk / Telegram) **auto-detect and deliver** it.
- **Any common file type**, up to a **20 MB** limit.
- **Contrast with `ReadFileTool`** — `ReadFileTool` **extracts text** from a file to feed the agent's reasoning; `send_file` ships the file **as-is** to the user.

### ReadFileTool — oversized-line paging (1.4.0+, #190)

For files with a very long single line, `ReadFileTool` adds an optional `startColumn` (a 1-based character offset within `startLine`) to **resume the tail** of that line from where you left off.

- On truncation it **always returns** `nextStartLine`;
- it **additionally returns** `nextStartColumn` when more of that line remains.

Feed both back into the next call to page through a giant single-line file in segments.

## Tool Guard — the permission layer

Tool Guard is how MateClaw keeps strong tools from doing stupid things. It's **rule-based**, not a flat dangerous-tools list. Each rule says: *for this tool, with these arguments, in this context, do X* — where X is `allow`, `deny`, or `require_approval`.

Core pieces:

- **`mate_tool_guard_rule`** — individual rules with tool pattern, optional arg pattern, action
- **`mate_tool_guard_config`** — global config: enabled/disabled, default policy, approval timeout
- **`mate_tool_guard_audit_log`** — every guarded call leaves an entry

Example rule: *allow `ShellExecuteTool` when the command starts with `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, or `find`. Require approval for anything else.*

```yaml
mateclaw:
  tool:
    guard:
      enabled: true
      default-policy: require_approval
      rules:
        - tool: ShellExecuteTool
          arg-pattern: "^(ls|cat|grep|find)\\s"
          action: allow
        - tool: WriteFileTool
          action: require_approval
```

Or manage interactively on `Settings → Security & Approval`. When a rule requires approval, the runtime persists a row in `mate_tool_approval` and suspends the agent turn. When the user decides, the agent resumes where it paused. Full mechanism in [Security & Approval](./security).

### Declarative hook system

Tool Guard rules are a special case of a more general mechanism — the **declarative hook system**. Five lifecycle hooks cover every critical moment in tool and LLM execution:

| Hook | Fires when | Typical use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `before_tool` | Before tool execution | Argument redaction, context injection, extra validation |
| `after_tool` | After tool execution | Result filtering, audit logging |
| `before_llm` | Before LLM call | Prompt enrichment, cache hit check |
| `after_llm` | After LLM returns | Output filtering, token accounting |
| `on_error` | On error | Alerting, fallback strategy |

Hooks run in-process. They can transform arguments, transform results, mask sensitive fields, and add audit log entries. You can use hooks for things beyond Tool Guard — like injecting a security policy before every LLM call, or auto-redacting sensitive fields from tool returns.

---

## Execution: concurrent, isolated, bounded

- **Concurrent execution** — within a turn, independent tool calls run in parallel. Guard checks are sequential; execution is concurrent where safe.
- **Per-tool timeouts** — every tool has its own timeout. Defaults: fast tools 30s, shell/browser 60s, generation tools up to 300s.
- **Segment isolation** — when approvals are needed mid-turn, the segment splits at the approval boundary.
- **Observation truncation** — long tool results are automatically truncated before being added to observation history.
- **Error isolation** — one tool failure does not abort the turn.

---

## Tool management via API

```bash
# List all tools
curl http://localhost:18088/api/v1/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Enable / disable
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:18088/api/v1/tools/1/toggle?enabled=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Set disclosure tier for a builtin or channel tool
curl -X PUT http://localhost:18088/api/v1/tools/1/disclosure-tier \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"tier": "core"}'
```

The current REST API manages tool rows, enabled state, and disclosure tier. Direct execution of builtin tools happens through the agent runtime, not through a `/tools/{name}/test` endpoint.

---

## Creating a custom tool

### Option 1: a `@Tool`-annotated Spring bean

```java
@Component
public class FactorialTool {

    @Tool(description = "Calculate the factorial of a number")
    public String factorial(
            @ToolParam(description = "The number to compute factorial for") int n) {
        long result = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return String.valueOf(result);
    }
}
```

- Spring `@Component`
- Every `@Tool` method becomes a callable tool
- Use `@ToolParam` on every parameter — that's the LLM description
- Return value is what the agent sees
- **If the tool is dangerous, add a Tool Guard rule for it**

Restart and the tool is live.

### Option 2: a skill script

Don't want to write Java? Bundle behavior into a skill package with a `SKILL.md` and a script. See [Skills](./skills).

### Option 3: an MCP server

Capability already exists as an MCP server? Just add the server configuration. See [MCP](./mcp).

## 2.1.0: progressive tool bridge and action completion

With a large tool catalog, MateClaw exposes a lightweight directory first and expands concrete schemas only when the task needs them. The progressive bridge reduces context pressure; normalized, enabled tool names are cached so long loops do not repeatedly scan the MCP hot path.

Action requests now carry a completion policy: when the user explicitly asks to send, create, delete, query an external system, or operate a browser, the runtime retries once if its ledger has no successful substantive tool call. A second text-only attempt ends as `action_unverified`; a substantive attempt that failed ends as `action_failed`, rather than claiming completion. This proves that a substantive call succeeded, not semantic equivalence between its result and the user's goal. Read-only explanations and answers that need no tool are unaffected.

`browser_use` hardens ref lifetime, navigation safety, session gates, wait conditions, and snapshots. Page changes explicitly invalidate old refs, and navigation/wait outcomes are diagnosable instead of silently clicking a stale element or crossing browser sessions.

The proactive `list_channel_sessions` / `send_channel_message` tools push only to verified conversations in the current workspace; see [Channels](./channels).
