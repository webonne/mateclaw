# Security & Approval

**Strong hands, firm limits.**

MateClaw gives agents real capability — shell access, file writes, browser automation, delegation to other agents, remote tools over MCP. That's the "strong hands" half. This page is about the other half: the limits that keep strong hands from doing stupid things.

- **JWT auth** — who you are
- **Tool Guard (rule-based)** — what each agent is allowed to do
- **Approval workflow** — when a human needs to decide before execution
- **File Guard** — what the filesystem looks like to an agent
- **Workspace isolation** — what each team can see
- **Audit log** — what everybody did, in order, forever

If you're running MateClaw in production, read this page top to bottom.

::: tip Agentic, but not autonomous
Every IT department and CISO in 2025–2026 has the same question before buying AI:

> **"What if the agent goes off the rails and deletes the wrong thing?"**

Anyone who tells you "AI won't go off the rails" is lying. MateClaw's answer is different — **the agent asks you first when it matters.**

When the agent wants to delete a file, send an email, run a write-side SQL, or hit a paid API — any tool call matched by a Tool Guard rule **pauses mid-turn**. An approval notification is pushed to your IM (Feishu / DingTalk / Slack / email). You tap approve, the agent resumes from where it stopped. Every action lands in `mate_tool_guard_audit_log` — append-only, retained as long as you want, CSV-exportable.

**Agentic — it acts. Not autonomous — it doesn't act on its own initiative for the things that matter.**

That's the line between "let AI do work for you" and "let AI make decisions for you." MateClaw stays on the left side of that line — which is also the side your CISO doesn't immediately say no to.

## JWT authentication

### How it works

1. The user posts credentials to `/api/v1/auth/login`
2. The server validates and returns a JWT
3. Every subsequent request includes the token in the `Authorization` header
4. The server validates the token on each request

### Logging in

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
    "tokenType": "Bearer",
    "expiresIn": 86400
  }
}
```

### Password change

Users can change their own password from the profile settings dialog. Admins can reset any member's password from member management.

---

### Sliding window renewal

MateClaw does sliding-window token renewal. When a token's remaining lifetime falls below the configurable `renewal-threshold` (default 2 hours / 7200000ms), the server issues a new token in the `X-New-Token` response header. The frontend picks it up and replaces the stored token transparently. Active users never get kicked out; idle sessions still expire on time.

### Configuration

```yaml
mateclaw:
  jwt:
    secret: your-secret-key-must-be-at-least-32-characters-long
    expiration: 86400000          # token lifetime (ms, default 24h)
    renewal-threshold: 7200000    # sliding renewal when remaining lifetime drops below this (ms)
```

::: warning
**Change the default JWT secret in production.** At least 32 characters. Set via env var (`JWT_SECRET=...`), never commit.
:::

### Error codes

| Code | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| 401 | Token missing, expired, or invalid | `{"code":401,"msg":"Token expired or invalid","data":null}` |
| 403 | Valid token but insufficient permissions | `{"code":403,"msg":"Forbidden","data":null}` |

Frontend handles both uniformly — redirect to login, clear stored tokens.

### Default credentials

MateClaw ships with `admin` / `admin123`. **Change this immediately in any deployment other than your laptop.**

### Spring Security config

- **Stateless sessions** — no server-side session; all state in the JWT
- **Public API endpoints** — `GET /api/v1/settings/language`, `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/chat/stream`, `/api/v1/chat/*/stop`, `/api/v1/agents/*/chat/stream`, `/api/v1/setup/**`, `/api/v1/channels/webhook/**`, `/api/v1/channels/webchat/**`, `/api/v1/talk/ws`, `/api/v1/files/generated/**`
- **Protected endpoints** — everything else under `/api/**`
- **CSRF disabled** — not needed for stateless JWT

---

## Tool Guard — rule-based permission engine

Tool Guard is how MateClaw decides what a tool call is allowed to do. **It's not a flat dangerous-tools list.** It's a rule engine. Each rule specifies: *for this tool, optionally matching these arguments, in this workspace, do X* — where X is `allow`, `deny`, or `require_approval`.

### The three tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **`mate_tool_guard_config`** | Global config — enabled, default policy, approval timeout, notification channels |
| **`mate_tool_guard_rule`** | Individual rules — tool pattern, optional arg regex, workspace scope, action, priority |
| **`mate_tool_guard_audit_log`** | Every guarded call gets an entry — tool, args, rule matched, decision, user, timestamp |

### How a rule is evaluated

```
Tool call arrives
      │
      ▼
Load rules for this workspace + global rules, sorted by priority
      │
      ▼
For each rule in priority order:
  ┌─ Does the tool name match the pattern?
  │  └─ No → next rule
  ├─ Does the arg pattern match (if any)?
  │  └─ No → next rule
  └─ Yes on both → apply this rule's action and stop
      │
      ▼
No rules matched → apply default policy
      │
      ▼
Action: allow / deny / require_approval
      │
      ▼
Write audit log entry
      │
      ▼
Execute / reject / suspend for approval
```

Rules with higher priority run first. First matching rule wins. A rule can be scoped to a specific workspace or global.

### Example rules

```
Rule 1 (priority 100):  ShellExecuteTool, arg matches "^(ls|cat|grep|find)\\s"  → allow
Rule 2 (priority 50):   ShellExecuteTool                                        → require_approval
Rule 3 (priority 50):   WriteFileTool, arg.path starts with "/tmp"              → allow
Rule 4 (priority 40):   WriteFileTool                                           → require_approval
Rule 5 (priority 30):   *                                                        → allow (default)
```

Read-only shell commands execute immediately. Anything else needs approval. File writes under `/tmp` are free; elsewhere they need approval. Everything else runs.

### Managing rules

`Settings → Security & Approval → Tool Guard Rules`: list, create, edit, reorder, disable. Or via config:

```yaml
mateclaw:
  tool:
    guard:
      enabled: true
      default-policy: require_approval
      rules:
        - tool: ShellExecuteTool
          arg-pattern: "^(ls|cat|grep|find)\\s"
          action: allow
          priority: 100
        - tool: ShellExecuteTool
          action: require_approval
          priority: 50
        - tool: WriteFileTool
          arg-pattern: "^/tmp/"
          action: allow
          priority: 50
        - tool: WriteFileTool
          action: require_approval
          priority: 40
```

Or via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/security/guard/rules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool": "ShellExecuteTool",
    "argPattern": "^(ls|cat|grep|find)\\s",
    "action": "allow",
    "priority": 100
  }'
```

### Credential-rule toggles (1.4.0)

Credential rules now support **per-rule control** — each rule can be enabled/disabled individually, each rule carries its own decision (allow / deny / require_approval), and the entire guard rule set can be **exported and imported as JSON** for migrating between deployments or version-controlling your policy.

### Dangerous pattern detection

In addition to user-defined rules, MateClaw's shell tool has built-in detection for patterns that are dangerous no matter what. `find -delete`, `rm -rf /`, piped downloads through `bash`, and similar patterns trigger elevated approval even if a rule would otherwise allow them.

---

## Approval workflow — human in the loop

When a rule evaluates to `require_approval`, MateClaw doesn't fail the call. It **suspends the agent mid-turn**, creates a pending approval, surfaces it to the user, and resumes exactly where it left off once the user decides.

::: tip From 1.3.0: workflows ride the same approval rail
The v1.3.0 [workflow](./workflow) `await_approval` step suspends the entire workflow run on the same `mate_tool_approval` table — persisted across restarts. Approval requests fan out to the approver's channel (Feishu / DingTalk / Slack / WeCom); once resolved, the workflow runtime auto-resumes the next step. One audit log, one notification pipeline, one "pause / resume" semantic — covering both agent tool calls and workflow steps.
:::

### How it flows

```
Agent calls tool
     │
     ▼
Tool Guard: require_approval
     │
     ▼
Create mate_tool_approval row (status=pending)
     │
     ▼
Set AWAITING_APPROVAL=true in graph state
     │
     ▼
Emit approval_required SSE event
     │
     ▼
Graph terminates cleanly
     │
     ▼
Frontend shows approval card
     │
     ▼
User clicks Approve or Reject
     │
     ▼
POST /api/v1/chat/stream with /approve or /deny
     │
     ├─ Approved → reload agent, replay tool call, continue reasoning
     └─ Rejected → send rejection as observation, continue reasoning
```

The "replay" mechanism is important. When the agent resumes, it **doesn't re-reason from scratch** — it skips straight to the approved tool call, executes it, and continues from the observation. No duplicate LLM calls, no wasted tokens.

The current web path has no write-style `POST /api/v1/approvals/{id}/resolve` endpoint. Approval and denial use the same SSE channel as normal chat so replay, persistence, and cancellation all stay on one lifecycle.

### The `mate_tool_approval` table

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `id` | Primary key |
| `agent_id` | Which agent is waiting |
| `conversation_id` | Which conversation is suspended |
| `tool_name` | The tool being called |
| `tool_args` | JSON of the actual arguments |
| `rule_id` | Which rule triggered the approval |
| `status` | `pending` / `approved` / `denied` / `consumed` / `timeout` / `superseded` |
| `requested_at` | When the approval was created |
| `resolved_at` | When the user decided |
| `resolved_by` | Who decided |
| `notes` | Optional user notes on the decision |

### Placeholder substitution

Sometimes the agent's tool arguments contain placeholders — a computed file path, a templated command. The approval workflow **resolves placeholders before showing the dialog**, so users see the actual values they're approving. Approval returns the resolved values too, so what the agent executes is exactly what the user saw.

### Timeouts

Pending approvals expire after a configurable timeout (default: 30 minutes). Expired approvals become `timeout`, and the agent treats expiry the same as user rejection.

### Notifications

MateClaw can notify through `channel/notification/` adapters — email, in-app alert, DingTalk/Feishu push. Configure in `Settings → Security & Approval → Notifications`.

### Current API surface

```bash
# Hydrate pending approvals after a page refresh
curl http://localhost:18088/api/v1/chat/{conversationId}/pending-approvals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Approve in the waiting conversation
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/chat/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId":"1","conversationId":"conv-abc123","message":"/approve"}'

# Reject in the waiting conversation
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/chat/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId":"1","conversationId":"conv-abc123","message":"/deny"}'

# Manage auto-approval grants
curl http://localhost:18088/api/v1/approval/grants \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Auto-approval: hits visible, misses explainable (2.0.0+)

The most maddening pre-2.0 scenario: you configured an auto-approval grant exactly as intuition suggested, and tool calls **still** went to human review — the grants page said "enabled", the audit log said only "needs approval", and nothing anywhere told you why the grant didn't fire. 2.0.0 makes the whole chain transparent:

- **Miss reasons are classified.** The resolver no longer lumps every miss into "no grant": **a grant exists but its severity ceiling is too low** (e.g. a LOW ceiling blocking a HIGH call — the most common trap), no candidate grant at all, workspace mismatch, CRITICAL forced to human review… each gets its own reason code.
- **The outcome lands on the audit row.** Every guard audit row records the auto-approval outcome and reason — auto-approved calls no longer misleadingly show "needs approval", and calls that went to review show *why* at a glance. Audit rows also carry the real pending-approval id, so you can jump from audit straight to that approval.
- **One-click grant creation from the audit page.** When you see a "severity ceiling too low" miss, a **create grant** shortcut sits right on the audit row, pre-filled with the tool name, scope, and suggested ceiling — no re-configuring from memory.
- **Anti-footgun forms.** Scope IDs switch from free text to **scope-typed pickers** (pick an agent for AGENT scope, a conversation for CONVERSATION, a workspace for WORKSPACE), eradicating type-mismatched dead grants at the source; the severity ceiling carries semantic hints ("LOW only auto-approves low-severity calls"); and **cross-workspace dead configurations are rejected at creation** — a grant that could never fire is called out on the spot instead of leaving you guessing in the audit log.

The hard floors are unchanged: CRITICAL always goes to a human, and safety-floor blocks stay non-negotiable.

## File Guard

File Guard is filesystem-level access control. It sits underneath any tool or skill that reads or writes files, and decides what paths are in-bounds.

### Evaluation pipeline

```
File access request
     │
     ▼
Path normalization (resolve .., symlinks, relative paths)
     │
     ▼
Allowlist check: is the path inside an allowed directory?
     │
     ▼
Denylist check: is the path inside a denied directory?
     │
     ▼
Symlink check: does following the path escape the sandbox?
     │
     ▼
Allow / Deny
```

### Rules built in

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Workspace isolation | Default access restricted to the workspace directory |
| System path denial | `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/boot`, etc. blocked |
| Sensitive file protection | `.ssh`, `.config`, `.env` blocked |
| Path traversal prevention | `../` attacks detected and blocked |
| Symlink check | Symlink targets resolved and re-validated |

### Configuration

Allowed / denied path rules live in the database and are managed from the admin Security page or `GET` / `PUT /api/v1/security/guard/config/file-guard` — **not application.yml**. The only YAML piece is the **global fallback sandbox root** that file/shell tools are confined to when a conversation has no per-workspace base path:

```yaml
mateclaw:
  workspace:
    sandbox:
      enabled: true                    # set false to restore the legacy unconstrained behaviour
      root: ${user.dir}/data/workspace # fallback sandbox root, created at startup
```

Visual editor on `Settings → Security & Approval → File Guard`.

---

## Workspace isolation

Workspaces are how MateClaw keeps multiple teams' data separate. Every agent, skill, wiki, conversation, and memory file belongs to exactly one workspace.

### Security primitives that follow workspace boundaries

- **File Guard** — path allowlists default to `workspace/{workspaceId}/...`
- **Tool Guard rules** — can be scoped to a specific workspace
- **Wiki knowledge bases** — owned by a workspace, readable only by members
- **Memory files** — every agent's memory is under its workspace's directory
- **Channels** — each channel belongs to a workspace

### Roles (four-tier RBAC)

Capabilities are **additive** — a higher role inherits everything below it.

| Role | Capabilities (added on top of the tier below) |
|------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Viewer** | `chat`, `view:wiki`. Read-only. So that chat works, a Viewer can also read the active model and read an employee's workspace files. |
| **Member** | Viewer + `view:memory`, `view:dashboard`, `manage:wiki`, `manage:agents` |
| **Admin** | Member + `manage:skills`, `manage:channels`, `manage:models`, `manage:security`, `manage:settings` |
| **Owner** | Same as Admin, plus owner-only: delete the workspace, transfer ownership |

**The backend is the single source of truth for capabilities** — it holds a `RoleCapabilities` mapping, and the frontend never derives them locally. After a workspace switch, or on a capability-related 403, the frontend calls `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/access`, which returns `memberRole`, `isGlobalAdmin`, `effectiveRole`, and `capabilities`.

**Global admin vs workspace role**: `mate_user.role='admin'` is the system-wide global admin — it manages users, creates workspaces, and spans **all** workspaces with owner-equivalent power even where it isn't a member; `mate_workspace_member.role` is per-workspace. System-level endpoints (models / providers / OAuth / datasources, user management, workspace creation) require a global admin (`@RequireGlobalAdmin`); workspace-scoped endpoints (skills / tools / plugins) require a workspace role — reads need Member, writes need Admin.

Full details in [Workspaces](./workspaces).

### What isolation does NOT cover

- **Shared global config** — JWT secret, model provider keys, MCP server definitions are global
- **Audit logs** — all workspaces' security events are in the same audit log; only admins with audit access read across workspaces

---

## Audit log

Every security-relevant action is recorded in `mate_audit_event`. **Append-only** — you can't modify an entry, and rows are retained for the configured window (default 90 days).

### What gets logged

| Event type | Captured data |
|------------|---------------|
| **Tool calls** | Tool name, args, result summary, duration, agent, workspace |
| **Tool Guard decisions** | Rule matched, action taken, rule ID |
| **Approvals** | Who approved/rejected, when, notes |
| **File Guard decisions** | Path, allow/deny, reason |
| **Skill executions** | Skill name, parameters, agent |
| **Login events** | User, IP, success/failure |
| **Configuration changes** | Old and new values for security-relevant settings |

### Entry schema

```
timestamp       When it happened
user_id         Who did it (system for automated events)
action          What they did
resource        What it was done to
details         JSON blob with the specifics
result          success / failure / denied
ip_address      Source IP when applicable
workspace_id    Which workspace this belongs to
```

### Querying

`Settings → Security & Approval → Audit Log`: filterable view by time range, event type, user, workspace, result. Export to CSV.

Via API:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:18088/api/v1/audit/events?from=2026-04-01&to=2026-04-11&action=tool_call" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

---

## Skill security scanning

Custom skills are scanned for dangerous patterns before they become active:

| Check | What it looks for |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Prompt injection** | Attempts to override system prompts, hidden instructions |
| **Dangerous tool references** | Tools not in the allowlist, or tools requiring approval without declaration |
| **External URL references** | Links to untrusted external resources |
| **Script injection** | Embedded scripts or code execution attempts |

### Severity levels

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `CRITICAL` | Install blocked; must be fixed |
| `HIGH` | Warning + admin must confirm |
| `MEDIUM` | Warning displayed; install allowed |
| `LOW` | Logged only |
| `INFO` | Logged only |

Scan reports live in `Settings → Security & Approval → Skill Scans`.

---

## API key protection

- API keys encrypted at rest in the database
- Keys **masked** (`sk-****abcd`) in every API response — never returned in full after creation
- MCP server `env_json` and `headers_json` values sanitized the same way
- Environment variable references (`${VAR}`) in MCP config resolve at runtime from the process environment

---

## Network security

### Production recommendations

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **HTTPS** | Reverse proxy with TLS (Nginx or Caddy) |
| **Disable H2 console** | `spring.h2.console.enabled=false` in production |
| **Firewall** | Only expose the public port |
| **Rate limiting** | Configure at the reverse proxy level |
| **Production database, not H2** | Follow the public Docker stack with PostgreSQL 16, or use a dedicated MySQL 8 / KingbaseES instance |

### Nginx reverse proxy example

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name mateclaw.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/mateclaw.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/mateclaw.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:18080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # SSE support
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }
}
```

### Outbound request protection (SSRF)

Every **outbound HTTP request an agent can drive** carries SSRF protection by default, so a manipulated agent can't be steered into probing your internal network or a cloud metadata endpoint. Three outbound paths are covered:

| Outbound path | Triggered by | Default behaviour |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Browser tool** | the `open` action of `browser_use` | resolves the target host and rejects restricted addresses |
| **Hook webhook** | the HTTP call of a hook action | host must be in `trusted-domains` AND must not be a private address |
| **Image download** | the image tool fetching a URL reference | rejects private / loopback hosts |

Address classes blocked by default: loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`), private (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), link-local (`169.254/16`, `fe80::/10`), any-local, multicast, and cloud metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`, `100.100.100.200`, `192.0.0.192`, …).

#### Allowing internal addresses: `mateclaw.security.ssrf-allowlist`

When an agent legitimately needs to reach an internal service, add it to the shared allowlist. **One setting, applied across all three outbound paths.** Each entry is one of:

| Form | Example | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| Literal hostname | `internal.corp` | case-insensitive exact match |
| Literal IP | `192.168.100.100` | matches that exact address |
| IPv4 CIDR block | `192.168.100.0/24` | matches every IP in the range |

```yaml
mateclaw:
  security:
    ssrf-allowlist:
      - 192.168.100.100      # a single internal address
      - 192.168.100.0/24     # a whole internal subnet
      - internal.corp        # an internal hostname
```

The allowlist opens **only the entries you list**: `192.168.100.0/24` does not also open `192.168.200.x`, and `192.168.100.100` does not open sibling IPs in the same subnet. Changes require a backend restart.

::: warning Keep it narrow
Allowlist entries **can re-expose cloud metadata endpoints** (e.g. `169.254.169.254`). Once exposed, a compromised agent could use one to steal cloud credentials. Add only the internal addresses you actually need, and **never** open things up with a broad CIDR such as `0.0.0.0/0` or `10.0.0.0/8`.
:::

The browser tool also has a master switch `mateclaw.browser.ssrf-check-enabled` (default `true`). Setting it to `false` **disables the SSRF check entirely** for the browser path — including the metadata endpoints — and is discouraged; prefer the allowlist above for precise exceptions.

---

## Security best practices

1. **Change the default password.** Right now. On every deployment.
2. **Set a real JWT secret.** At least 32 characters, via environment variable, never committed.
3. **Least privilege.** Only enable the tools agents actually need.
4. **Default to `require_approval`.** Flip the Tool Guard default policy, then add `allow` rules for safe cases. Newly added tools default to safe.
5. **Configure File Guard.** Lock down allowed/denied paths before any agent touches the filesystem in anger.
6. **Review audit logs regularly.** Set a recurring reminder. Look for anomalies.
7. **Watch your skill scans.** CRITICAL findings shouldn't be bypassed lightly.
8. **Isolate networks.** Ollama, H2 console, internal MCP servers — none should be public.
9. **Don't skip approvals in production.** Auto-approve rules should be narrow and specific. `allow *` is a crisis waiting to happen.

---

## Security configuration reference

application.yml carries **three** security-related blocks — JWT, the filesystem sandbox, and the outbound request allowlist:

```yaml
mateclaw:
  jwt:
    secret: ${JWT_SECRET:your-secret-key-at-least-32-chars}
    expiration: 86400000          # token lifetime (milliseconds)
    renewal-threshold: 7200000    # sliding renewal when remaining lifetime drops below this (ms)

  # Global fallback sandbox for file/shell tools: when a conversation has no
  # per-workspace base path, all file/shell operations are confined to this
  # root (fail-closed default)
  workspace:
    sandbox:
      enabled: true
      root: ${user.dir}/data/workspace

  # Outbound SSRF allowlist: permit specific internal hosts/IPs/CIDR blocks,
  # shared by the browser, hook, and image-download outbound paths. Empty means
  # every private address is blocked by the default policy.
  security:
    ssrf-allowlist: []            # e.g. [192.168.100.100, 192.168.100.0/24]
```

**Everything else is managed in the database — from the admin Security page (or `/api/v1/security/guard/*`), not application.yml:**

- **Tool Guard** switch, default policy, rules, approval timeout (default 30 minutes), notification channels → `mate_tool_guard_config` / `mate_tool_guard_rule`
- **File Guard** allowed / denied path rules → `GET` / `PUT /api/v1/security/guard/config/file-guard`
- **Audit log** is always on, written row by row to `mate_tool_guard_audit_log`, exportable as CSV
- **Skill security scan** findings surface during skill installation; CRITICAL findings are blocked by default
